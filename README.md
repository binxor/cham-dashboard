# Cham Dashboard
This project was boilerplated using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)(https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html) , because react is a pain in the ass to configure in a vacuum.  [Tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html)

```sh
$ npm install create-react-app 
$ create-react-app cham
```


Here's a summary of commands provided with the install:
| COMMAND | RESULT |
| ------ | ------ |
| ``` $ npm start ``` | _Starts the development server._ |
| ``` $ npm run build ``` | _Bundles the app into static files for production._ |
| ``` $ npm test ``` | _Starts the test runner._ |
| ``` $ npm run eject ``` | _Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!_ |
